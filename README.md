# Sleep-Time-Calculator
## Description
A Sleep-Time Calculator helps optimize your sleep by calculating ideal bedtimes or wake-up times based on 90-minute sleep cycles. Since the average person goes through several sleep cycles each night, waking up at the end of a cycle rather than in the middle of one can help you feel more refreshed and alert.

## Built with:
* React 19
* Material UI(MUI)
* JavaScript
* HTML5/CSS3
